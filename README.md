✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve shell`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Color Configuration

### CSS Variables

- `--app-background-drawer-outlet-x-button`: Background color for the drawer outlet's close (X) button

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/core-features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

## Library Release Process

This project uses semantic-release to automatically publish library updates based on commit messages.

### Commit Convention

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`

**Scopes**: `ngx-liburg`, `ngx-liburg-icon`, `ngx-liburg-frame-side`, `repo`

**Examples**:
- `feat(ngx-liburg): add new table sorting feature`
- `fix(ngx-liburg-icon): resolve icon alignment issue`

### Setting Up Locally

Run the setup script to install necessary dependencies:

```bash
./scripts/setup-semantic-release.sh
```

### Automated Release Process

When you push to the `main` branch with changes to library files, GitHub Actions will:

1. Detect which libraries have changes
2. Determine version bumps based on commit messages
3. Update changelogs and package versions
4. Publish the libraries to npm

You can also manually trigger a dry run from the GitHub Actions tab.
